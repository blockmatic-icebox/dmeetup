## Problem

A lot people run communities and workshops and have to pay centralized solutions to publish and promote their events. Many of these solutions don't make easy to manage reservation and charge for the participation, and if they do most platform don't support cryptocurrencies yet, so you need to charge through centralized payment gateways.

It's sometimes to difficult for a meetup group organizers to incentivize and engage community members in active participation through reviews, comments and events promotion.

## Solution & Product

A blockchain-based platform rewards the community members for their contributions. You will be able to build a reputation and get rewarded in crypto. 

By financially and reputationally incentivising the meetup groups organizers and active members of these communities we aim to create a platform that will accelerate knowledge sharing and collaboration, where members are fairly rewarded for their efforts and contributions to the communities.

Users are incentivized to attend events and add value to meetup groups. In order to reserve your spot at an event the you have to stake tokens, which you will get back the day of the event if you attend. The tokens of the people that don't show up gets distributed among the attendees and a portion of it goes to meetup group balance.

You will be able to build a reputation, get rewarded and charge a fee in crypto for attending your events. The platform rewards the organizers, speakers and active members through the MEETUP token. 

Each meetup group is an independent DAC with it's own balance.

Companies can sponsor meetups events and groups and get exposure on the dMeetup platform.

The profits of each meetup group gets distributed among all members proportionally to their contributions to the group.

It's a tokenized version of [Meetup](https://meetup.com/) with incentives for the community members.
A version of [Steemit](https://steemit.com/) for events and workshops.

## MVP

The minimum viable product must be able to provide the users with a set of tools that allows them to complete the most general tasks. For a MVP this tasks should include:

- Searching or browsing for groups or/and meetups.
- Joining groups and/or meetups.
- Creating groups or/and meetups.
- Communicating with other users, groups or meetups, via comments.
- Monetization.
