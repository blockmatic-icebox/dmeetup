DMeetup is a events portal that rewards you for organizing and attending meetups and workshops.

## Problem

A lot people run meetup communities and have to pay centralized solutions to publish and promote their events. 

It's sometimes to difficult for a meetup group organizer to incentivize and engage community members in active participation.

## Solution

A blockchain-based platform that rewards the community members for their contributions and active participation. 

Users are incentivized to attend events and add value to meetup groups. In order to reserve your spot at an event the you have to stake tokens, which you will get back the day of the event if you attend. The tokens of the people that don't show up get distributed among the attendees and a portion of it goes to meetup group balance.

Companies can sponsor meetups events and groups and get exposure on the dMeetup platform.

## MVP

The minimum viable product must be able to provide the users with a set of tools that allows them to complete the most general tasks. For a MVP this tasks should include:

- Searching or browsing for groups or/and meetups.
- Joining groups and/or meetups.
- Creating groups or/and meetups.
- Communicating with other users, groups or meetups, via comments.
