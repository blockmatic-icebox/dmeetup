# ÐMeetup Whitepaper - WIP

An incentivized, blockchain-based, meetups and workshops platform and economic system.

## Problem

A lot people run communities and workshops and have to pay centralized solutions to publish and promote their events. Many of this solutions don't make easy to manage reservation and charge for the participation, and if they do most platform don't support cryptocurrencies yet, so you need to charge thru centralized payment gateways.

It's sometimes to difficult for a meetup group organizers to incentivize and engage community members in active participation through reviews, comments and events promotion.

## Solution & Product

A decentralized platform and economic system that rewards the community members for organizing meetup events and workshops, both onsite and online. You will be able to build a reputation and get rewarded in crypto. There are also incentives for active members in a community group, not only for the organizers. The platform will allow to charge in crypto for your events and workshops.

It's a decentralized version of [Meetup](https://meetup.com/) with token incentives for the community members.
A version of [Steemit](https://steemit.com/) for on-site and online events and workshops.

It is a 100% open-source and community-driven project. Our goal is to create a sharing economy without intermediaries, allowing people to transact directly with one another in a distributed, trust-minimized fashion.

### Key product feature and benefits

- Build a reputation in the community based on your contributions.
- Reduce the costs of starting and organizing community groups, basically zero on the platform.
- Get rewarded financially for your efforts on organizing events and workshops.
- Remove intermediaries in the value exchange network.

### Value Proposition

By financially and reputationally incentivising the meetup groups organizers and active members of these communities we aim to create a platform that will accelerate knowledge sharing and community groups sustainability, where members are fairly rewarded for their efforts and contributions to the communities.
